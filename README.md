# D7049E - Game engine
In the course D7049E (Virtual interactive environments) at Luleå University of Technology, we are tasked with developing a game engine in any chosen language. We have chosen to use C# with the MonoGame framework. The game engine is then used to implement a game, and for this case we create a top-down shooter where enemies spawn in waves and attack the player.

Milestones are provided in the "Milestones" folder.
