# D7049E - Game engine
In the course D7049E (Virtual interactive environments) at Luleï¿½ University of Technology, we are tasked with developing a game engine in any chosen language. We have chosen to use C# with the MonoGame framework. The game engine is then used to implement a game, and for this case we create a top-down shooter where enemies spawn in waves and attack the player.

Milestones are provided in the "Milestones" folder.

The engine is made using ECS and features support for 3D physics, 3D models, cameras, etc.
