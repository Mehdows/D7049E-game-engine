# D7049E, Virtual interactive environments, Lp4, V23
Virtual interactive environments or VIEs are computer-generated 
environments that simulate a physical environment, 
allowing users to interact with the virtual world in real-time.

In this course we were asked to create a game engine using a data oriented approach and implement a simple game using the engine. We decided to write ours in C# using the [MonoGame framework](https://www.monogame.net/) together with [BEPU Physics](https://www.bepuentertainment.com/).

## Game Engine

In the course D7049E (Virtual interactive environments) at Lule√• University of Technology, we are tasked with developing a game engine in any chosen language. We have chosen to use C# with the MonoGame framework. The game engine is then used to implement a game, and for this case we create a top-down shooter where enemies spawn in waves and attack the player.

Milestones are provided in the "Milestones" folder.

The engine is made using ECS and features support for 3D physics, 3D models, AI Behaviour trees, cameras, etc.
